# CS568 Assignment 7 - Forms

Tasks:
- Practice the React Ref. For example, associate the Ref with an input. Then focus on the input using Ref. Console log its value directly without storing the value in a state when clicking on a button via Ref.
- Implement Custom Dynamic Input Component.
- Choose your project title. Define requirements. Don’t make it too big or complicated. Just focus on a couple of main tasks that the app does for now. Start small and extend as time goes.

- Create a “sign up” form that has the following fields:
```
Email (required, must be in the right format)
Name (required, no numbers in it)
Phone number (optional) should be in the right format (+13216549871). Use react-phone-number-input library
Password (required)
You can have more custom attributes if needed.
```
- Create a “sign-in” form.
- Create a couple of forms that add 2 objects to your app.
- Make sure you do all possible validations when submitting. You can use validation libraries.

Miscellaneous:
- You can build the forms using tools like Formik.
- Make sure your forms include various kinds of input elements such as Radio button, Dropdown, Select, Text area (or rich text editor, or markdown editor. For that, you can also use another library).
- Style it nicely. You can integrate you react app with other styling libraries like Bootstrap. Or you can also use already-styled components by including libraries like Material UI.

Submit your code and email me how it looks like. For now, show all forms on one page. Later we will learn to create separate pages for each form.

Bonus: Integrate the tag it library with React. Email me. Email subject: “CS568-Apr-Bonus-2”
