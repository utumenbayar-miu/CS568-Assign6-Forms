# CS568 Assignment 7 - Forms

Tasks:
- Practice the React Ref. For example, associate the Ref with an input. Then focus on the input using Ref. Console log its value directly without storing the value in a state when clicking on a button via Ref.
- Implement Custom Dynamic Input Component.
- Choose your project title. Define requirements. Donâ€™t make it too big or complicated. Just focus on a couple of main tasks that the app does for now. Start small and extend as time goes.

Extra: Integrate the tag it library with React.
